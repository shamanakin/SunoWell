## Suno assumptions snapshot

Copy from `../../SUNO-VERSION.md` and keep it short:

```text
Suno assumptions snapshot (from SUNO-VERSION.md, YYYY-MM-DD):
- Style prompts: tight palette, explicit arrangement, explicit energy
- Lyrics prompts: POV + structure + singability constraints
- Iteration: change one knob per batch and record results
```
