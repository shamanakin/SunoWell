# Style Recipes (SunoWell prompt pack)

This file contains reusable "style prompt recipes." They are starting points, not templates you must copy verbatim.

Rule: prefer a tight palette over a long list. Specify arrangement, tempo band, and texture.

## Style prompt format

Use this format:

```text
GenreAnchor: <1 to 2 genre labels max>
TempoEnergy: <tempo band + energy>
Instrumentation: <primary instruments>
Texture: <mix, space, grit, brightness>
Structure: <if relevant: intro/verse/chorus dynamics>
Mix: <modern/lofi/wide/intimate>
BanList: <what must not appear>
```

Then collapse it into a single copy/paste line for Suno.
