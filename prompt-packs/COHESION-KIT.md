# Cohesion Kit (SunoWell prompt pack)

Use this pack to keep an album coherent while avoiding boredom.

Core idea:
- lock the palette
- vary a small set of approved knobs

---

## Cohesion levers

### 1) Palette words (style)
Pick 6 to 12 palette words that appear across most StylePrompts:
- instruments: synth pad, electric guitar, pulsing sub
- textures: airy, tight, warm, crisp, nocturnal
- mix: modern clean, intimate vocal pocket

### 2) Banned elements
Write a short ban list that prevents drift:
- no trap hats
- no acoustic guitars
- no orchestral brass
- no chipmunk vocals

### 3) Motif controls (lyrics)
Pick 2 to 4 recurring motifs:
- a repeated phrase
- a recurring image
- a recurring "problem/solution" frame

Rule: do not force all motifs into every song. Rotate them.

### 4) Chorus shape rotation
Choose 2 to 3 chorus shapes and rotate them across tracks:
- 4-line anchor phrase chorus (repeat first line)
- call and response chorus
- mantra chorus (same first and last line)

### 5) Energy arc
Define an energy map across the album:
- track 1: invitation
- track 2: tension
- track 3: release
- track 4: quiet center
- track 5: peak
- track 6: resolve

This keeps cohesion while making listening feel like movement.

## Controlled variation knobs (pick 3 to 5)

These are allowed to vary track-to-track:
- tempo within a narrow band
- arrangement density (sparse vs full)
- vocal intensity (intimate vs confident)
- rhythmic complexity (simple vs syncopated)
- texture (clean vs light grit)

Hard rule:
- do not vary more than two knobs heavily in the same track

## Cohesion checklist (before finalizing a batch)

- StylePrompts share palette words
- Ban list is respected
- Chorus shape is not repeated too many times
- Energy arc is represented
- At least one motif returns (not necessarily in every track)
