## Status

- State: drafted
- Last worked: 2025-12-12

## Intent

Invitation into the album palette with a clear chorus hook about rebuilding focus.

---

## Style constraints

- Palette words: crisp, warm, airy, tight drums, pulsing sub, subtle glitch, melodic motif, modern clean mix
- Tempo target: 100–112 BPM
- Must-have elements: tight drums, warm bass/sub, repeating synth motif
- Ban list: no trap hats as main texture, no orchestral brass, no acoustic guitar bed

---

## Lyric constraints

- POV: first person
- Theme: rebuilding focus without shame
- Tone: direct, grounded, specific
- Motifs allowed: signal vs noise, repair vs replace
- Clichés banned: generic motivational slogans, vague abstractions
- Structure: Verse 1 (8), Chorus (4), Verse 2 (8), Chorus (4), Bridge (4), Final Chorus (4)
- Hook rule: chorus repeats the first line each time
