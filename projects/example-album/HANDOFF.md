# Handoff (example)

## Handoff - 2025-12-12
- Completed: Example album scaffold created. Baseline batch drafted (SW01–SW08).
- Current palette summary: crisp/warm/airy alt-electronic with tight drums, pulsing sub, subtle glitch, modern clean mix.
- Current lyric world summary: first-person, direct, concrete images; motifs about signal vs noise and repair.
- Last batch outcome: not yet run in Suno.
- Open questions:
  - Do we want one instrumental interlude track?
  - Should SW06 be the peak instead of SW08?
- Next step: Generate the copy/paste batch blocks for SW01–SW08 and run them in Suno, then paste back links/IDs and notes.
